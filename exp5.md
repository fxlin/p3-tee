# Exp 5: secure vision -- beta

## Beta version (40%)

Based on the alpha version, now implement the full functions: 

* The data in & out of the secure world **must be encrypted**
* The license plate detection **should work** in the secure world. 

## Testing (30%)

How would you test your secure vision program? Using what datasets? 

How do you determine the correctness of your implementation?

How would you automate the testing? 

## Benchmarking (30%)

Measure the throughput (not latency) of your program. Follow the norm of benchmarking as we have discussed online. 

State the throughput you will use (e.g. what quantity per second?)
