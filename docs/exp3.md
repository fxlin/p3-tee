*For reference only. UVA students: please refer to our formal assignments.* 

## Q&A (20%)

In your own words, describe what the following commands do: INJECT, TRANSFORM, and DUMP. 

What is macro CFG_CACHE_API for? In what condition is it defined/undefined? 

## Measurement (80%)

Modify the given sdp example to implement the following functions: INJECT X bytes of data; TRANSFORM the data by flipping every bit; DUMP the results. 

From the normal world, measure the end-to-end delay when X is: [1KB, 4KB, 16KB, 128KB, 1MB, 4MB, 16MB]

Submit raw measurement logs and a plot showing the measurement results. Do NOT just run once, or report average values only. Refer to our lecture on benchmark etiquette.
